k8s 

deployment
------------
its for stateless  app 
replicsa set is subset of deployment 
here all  pods share same port and same container image  
==============================================================================

node port vs cluster ip 
------------------------
node  port 
-------------
exposes node ip not pod ip 
pod ip is dynamic 
Exposes the service on Node IP

Fixed port range: 30000–32767

Internet traffic comes to Node IP, not Pod IP

In EKS:
---------
Worker nodes usually have private IPs

NodePort is typically accessed via:

LoadBalancer

Ingress

Direct NodePort internet access is not recommended


Service  and cluster ip
--------------------------
❓ “Service is used to assign static IP, right?”
✅ Yes — but NOT to Pods

👉 Service assigns a static IP to itself
❌ Service does NOT give IPs to Pods

🔍 What exactly gets the static IP?
🔹 Service

Gets a ClusterIP (stable, virtual IP)

This IP:

Stays same for the life of the Service

Is used as a fixed entry point


Egress
Pod
   ↓
Service / Direct IP
   ↓
NAT Gateway / Firewall / Proxy
   ↓
Internet / External Service

Cluster IP
-----------
Pod A → ClusterIP (Service) → Pod B
Pod A never needs to know Pod B’s dynamic IP

ClusterIP gives a stable entry point

Works for internal communication only


======================================================================================================================
SSL certificate |

Provides encryption to webiste , api , db etc 


Ingress controller performs ssl/tls termination 

🔹 What SSL/TLS termination means

Decrypting encrypted HTTPS traffic at a trusted point

It:

Terminates the encrypted connection

Converts traffic to plain HTTP internally

📌 This is safe inside a private cluster network



Node Selector  is for environment isolation
---------------

NodeSelector in simple words 

NodeSelector lets you choose which nodes a pod can run on, based on node labels.

Nodes can be labeled with environments like env=dev, env=test, env=prod.

Pods use NodeSelector to specify which labeled nodes they are allowed to run on.

This ensures pods start only on the nodes of the correct environment.

🔹 Example

Node labels:

kubectl label nodes node1 env=prod
kubectl label nodes node2 env=dev
