k8s 

deployment
------------
its for stateless  app 
replicsa set is subset of deployment 
here all  pods share same port and same container image  
==============================================================================

node port vs cluster ip 
------------------------
node  port 
exposes node ip not pod ip 
pod ip is dynamic 
Exposes the service on Node IP

Fixed port range: 30000–32767

Internet traffic comes to Node IP, not Pod IP

In EKS:
---------
Worker nodes usually have private IPs

NodePort is typically accessed via:

LoadBalancer

Ingress

Direct NodePort internet access is not recommended


Service  and cluster ip
--------------------------
❓ “Service is used to assign static IP, right?”
✅ Yes — but NOT to Pods

👉 Service assigns a static IP to itself
❌ Service does NOT give IPs to Pods

🔍 What exactly gets the static IP?
🔹 Service

Gets a ClusterIP (stable, virtual IP)

This IP:

Stays same for the life of the Service

Is used as a fixed entry point
