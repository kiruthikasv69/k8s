node affinity
--------------
Node affinity is used to control pod placement based on node labels with both strict and preferred rules. 
It is commonly used for workload separation, hardware-specific scheduling, availability zone control, and cost optimization.

nodeSelector = must
node affinity = must or prefer

Node affinity has two types: required and preferred. 
Required node affinity enforces strict scheduling rules, while preferred node affinity provides flexible placement based on node labels.
Both are evaluated only during scheduling and ignored during execution.

Scheduling = deciding which NODE will run the POD

Happens when:

Pod is created

Pod is Pending

No node is assigned yet

Who does it?

kube-scheduler
==================================================================
Execution = pod is already running on a node

Happens after:

Scheduler assigns a node

kubelet starts the pod

What happens here?

Image is pulled (if not present)

Container starts

App runs

===================================================================================
Scheduling is the phase where Kubernetes decides which node a pod should run on. 
Execution refers to the runtime phase after the pod is assigned to a node and the containers are running. 
Node affinity rules are applied only during scheduling and ignored during execution.

📌 Use case:

Cost optimization

Performance preference

Spot vs on-demand
