Node Selector
-------------
NodeSelector is a simple scheduling mechanism that places pods on nodes matching specific labels.

NodeSelector is used to run a pod on nodes based on the labels specified on the nodes.

🧠 Even simpler (one line)

NodeSelector tells Kubernetes to schedule a pod only on nodes with matching labels.

Taint means “restricted access”
-----------------------------------------------
High CPU / high memory nodes are:

Node type / instance size

Resource capacity

A tainted node is a specially reserved node that does not accept normal pods unless they explicitly tolerate the taint.

Usecase 
Databases

ML jobs

Heavy batch processing

Why?

These apps need high CPU / memory

Normal apps should not run there


Taint and tolerants 
-----------------------
Taints and tolerations are used to reserve specific nodes for specific workloads and prevent unwanted pods from running on them.

Taints are applied on nodes to repel pods, and tolerations are applied on pods to allow them to be scheduled on tainted nodes. This helps reserve nodes for specific workloads.
